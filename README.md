# The Lottery !!

This is a distributed client-server application that reproduces the game of Lottery. The application must allow various client hosts (players) to make plays and send them to a
remote server, whose task is to store the bets, make the draws and process the winnings, notifying the amount to the players.

The game of Lotto (or simply Lotto) is a gambling game that consists in the extraction of five numbers between 1 and 90, with a prize for those who guess at least one.<br>
Each draw involves eleven wheels:  *Bari, Cagliari, Firenze, Genova, Milano, Napoli, Palermo, Roma, Torino, Venezia* and *Nazionale*.

In each draw, five numbers between 1 and 90 are drawn for each wheel, without re-insertion. The game consists of betting on the numbers that will be drawn on the various wheel.<br>
The order in which they are extracts is not significant. You can bet on the release of one or more numbers on a wheel, on multiple wheels or on all wheels.<br>

In particular, given a wheel, we talk about the type of bet:
- **Estratto**, if you bet on the draw out of only one number;<br>
- **Ambo**, if you bet on the simultaneous draw out of two numbers;<br>
- **Terno**, if you bet on the simultaneous draw out of three numbers;<br>
- **Quaterno**, if you bet on the simultaneous draw out of four numbers;<br>
- **Cinquina**, if you bet on the simultaneous draw out of five numbers.<br>

The winning amount is fixed and depends on how many numbers have been guessed, on what has been played (Ambo, Terno, etc.), and how many numbers have been played.

| Number played     | Number guessed | Winning amount (€)     |
| :---:        |    :----:   |          :---: |
| 1      | 1       | 11,23   |
| 2   | 2        | 250      |
| 3      | 3       | 4.500   |
| 4   | 4        | 120.000      |
| 5      | 5       | 6.000.000   |

In the same bet, it is possible to combine more types of bets. A player could for example play the numbers 5, 18 and 33, betting € 1 on the *Terno* and € 2 on *Ambo*. If a *Terno* comes out of the five numbers drawn, the player wins 4500 €. If both are rolled, the player wins an amount equal to € 250 / k, where k is the number of *Ambo* generated by numbers 5, 18, and 33. If more than one come out, the previous amount is multiplied by the number of *Ambo* drow out.<br>
If more wheels are indicated in the same ticket, the previous considerations continue to apply, but the amounts are equally spread over the chosen wheels. So, for example, player could do the same play described above, but this time indicate two wheels: *Roma* and *Firenze*. In this case, the winnings amount would be divided by two, so the *Terno* drow out on one of the two wheels is paid € 2250, while the *Ambo* are paid each 250 / 2k €.<br>
Finally, if Player makes the bet on all of the wheels, the winnings are divided by 11 (total number of wheels). So, if the *Terno* comes out on *Napoli* and two *Ambo* (for example one on *Bari* and the other on the *Nazione*) player wins € 4500/11 for the terno, plus € 250 / 11k for each of the two *Ambo*.
